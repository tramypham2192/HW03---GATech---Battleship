In this challenge, I accomplished these new skills:
- Just take one Scanner object in main method. Other Scanner objects are put into parameter in other methods
- Know when should write private methods to support methods, to make code cleaner
- More familiar with operations on 2D array

Things that needed to be done:
- create a do-while loop
- not alter premade printBattleShip method
- 100 new lines must follow the printed board so that the other player will not see the entered coordinates and board of their opponent.
- An ‘X’ character will represent a space with a ship that has been hit.
  An ‘O’ character will represent a space that was fired upon, but since there is not ship at that location, the shot was a miss.
- To prevent trivialization of the assignment, you may only import java.util.Scanner.
